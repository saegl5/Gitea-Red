Nov 16, 2022 · forked, rebased theme from Gitea's default theme, adopted colors and codes from fork, added/edited others

    Originally, just rebased from Gitea's default theme and adopted some colors from Gitea-Red-Silver.
    This is, did not review theme-redsilver.css line by line.

    This time around, I did.
    Saying this hoping that, whoever views the commits, does not mistakenly believe that coding was that clean or simple.
    Attempted changes using Safari's developer mode, and tested them by updating theme-red.css and restarting Gitea; I repeated this procedure several times.

    In doing so, some codes were rewritten (e.g., color in .home a {}), added (e.g., .full.height {}), or removed (e.g., ::-webkit-scrollbar {}).
    Some codes were added but then removed (e.g., ::selection {}), whereas some were refined (e.g., .home .hero .svg {} to .home .svg {}).
    For some codes, I could not find a usage case for (e.g., --color-primary-dark-1).

    Removed changes to: scrollbar, header, dividers, input elements, activity bar graph, labels, and breadcrumbs.

    File folders color uses --color-primary

    Lastly, you do not always need !important (e.g., for colors in :root {}).
    In fact, sometimes you cannot use !important (e.g., I could not use !important for .ui.tabular.menu because it would clash with !important in .ui.secondary.tabular.menu).
    To circumvent that, be more specific (e.g., instead of .ui.tabular.menu {}, input .ui.tabular.stackable.menu.navbar {}).
    Of course, being more specific may result in other related attributes not changing. So, be sure to retest any change.
